# CompressMyImage
This windows forms app will allow you to easily make a image bigger and smaller and allow you to try out different Image formats with the hope to make the file size smaller without losing quality.

***It is worth noting that this App is designed for 64bit computers as it allow faster loading when resizing images and also allow for bigger images to be made as well***

*Please Note the following information bellow*
```diff
- When debuging the project please make sure that you Debug in 64bit mode otherwise it will throw an exsption
