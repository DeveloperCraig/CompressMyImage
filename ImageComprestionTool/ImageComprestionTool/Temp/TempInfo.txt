------------------------------------------------------What is in temp info?-----------------------------------------------------------



Inside this folder can be files created when a image is trying to be converted or compressed.

These files can become fairly large at times depending on the computers hardware.

Higher the specs of the computer means that there is a much lower chance of temp files being created, this is due to the 
computer being able to process all of the image data.
However, a lower spec computer might need some help to convert larger images which is why large temp files might appear in this folder.
